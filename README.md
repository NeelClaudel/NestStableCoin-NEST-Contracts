# Nest Stable Coin Protocol

This is a Work in progress of the Nest Stable Coin using the Rust Foundry library for crafting deployment ofÂ Solidity Smart contract. Latest testnet version deployed on Sepolia Network and verified buy Etherscan.io.

# About

This project is meant to be a stablecoin where users can deposit WETH and WBTC in exchange for a token that will be pegged to the USD.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [Rust] Language setup and ready to use.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/NeelClaudel/StableNest-Contracts.git
cd StableNest-Contracts
forge build
```

# Updates
- The latest version of openzeppelin-contracts has changes in the ERC20Mock file. To follow along with the course, you need to install version 4.8.3 which can be done by ```forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.8.3 --no-commit``` instead of ```forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit```

# Usage

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Deploy - Other Network

[See below](#deployment-to-a-testnet-or-mainnet)

## Testing

1. Unit
2. Integration
3. Forked
4. Staging
 
```
forge test
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

and for coverage based testing: 

```
forge coverage --report debug
```


# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

Set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Scripts

Instead of scripts, we can directly use the `cast` command to interact with the contract. 

For example, on Sepolia:

1. Get some WETH 

```
cast send 0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81 "deposit()" --value 0.1ether --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

2. Approve the WETH

```
cast send 0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81 "approve(address,uint256)" 0x091EA0838eBD5b7ddA2F2A641B068d6D59639b98 1000000000000000000 --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

3. Deposit and Mint NEST

```
cast send 0x091EA0838eBD5b7ddA2F2A641B068d6D59639b98 "depositCollateralAndMintDsc(address,uint256,uint256)" 0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81 100000000000000000 10000000000000000 --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```


## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`


# Formatting


To run code formatting:
```
forge fmt
```
